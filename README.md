# WinePhPrediction
Predicting Ph of a given new wine if few historical data of chemical contents are known.

Knowing the pH of any wine is important to determine its quality in the multi billion industry.
In this notebook I am trying to find the pH of wine if some of its chemical/physical properties (fixed acidity','citric acid', 'density', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide','residual sugar' and 'chlorides') are given.

All the works are in WinePhPrediction.ipynb file.

For creating this notebook I have taken the famous winequality dataset from UCI public repository.
